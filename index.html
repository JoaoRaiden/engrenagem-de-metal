          The Purgatory Theory is a fan theory about the characters from the TV show Ed, Edd n Eddy that suggest they are dead and living in a purgatory-like state. The theory suggests that the kids are from The Cul-de-sac, come from different eras, and the early 1900s to the early 2000s. This would explain why the show's year is hard to pinpoint and why there aren't many adults in the show. The theory also suggests that the kids' previous lives and debts fit well with how they are portrayed in the show. The theory suggests that the green-purple color of the kids' tongues is the color of the people when they die. You can also watch a video where Ed, Edd and Eddy are actually DEAD!
